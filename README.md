# Road to Rust ðŸ¦€

Welcome to the **Road to Rust** repository! This project is dedicated to documenting my journey of learning and mastering the Rust programming language. Rust is known for its performance, safety, and concurrency features, making it an ideal choice for systems programming and much more.

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives

The main goals of this repository are:

- **Understand the basics of Rust**: Syntax, control flow, and data structures.
- **Explore Rust's memory management**: Learn about ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- **Build projects**: Apply Rust concepts through hands-on projects and examples.
- **Master concurrency in Rust**: Understand threads, async programming, and safe concurrency.
- **Dive into Rust's ecosystem**: Work with Cargo, Crates, and Rust tools.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DHurtado714-itesm/road-to-rust.git
   cd road-to-rust
   ```

2. **Install Rust**:

   Follow the official [Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust on your machine.

```curl
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## ðŸŒŸ Projects

Here are some of the projects I plan to build during this journey:

1. CLI Tools: Simple command-line tools to get familiar with Rust syntax and standard libraries.
2. Web Server: A basic HTTP server to explore Rust's concurrency features.
3. Game Development: A small game to understand memory safety and real-time processing.
4. Concurrency Experiments: Programs that utilize Rust's concurrency model, including async and multithreading.
